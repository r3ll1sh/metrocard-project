    <h1>MetroCard Kiosk</h1>


    <h3>Storyboarding Project</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I chose to focus on the kiosks in the New York City subway. The NYC Subway is
    used by millions of riders, and is one of the largest systems in the world.
    Riders use MetroCards to pay, which they buy at kiosks in most stations. </p>

    <br>
    <p>The kiosks, officially known as MetroCard Vending Machines (MVMs), allows for the
    purchase of new MetroCards or the refill of existing cards,
    accepting cash or credit card. They were created in 1999 by the design firm <a href="http://www.antennadesign.com/Transit/5-metrocard-vending-machine">Antenna</a>. </p>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>To examine the design of the kiosks, I first developed a set of questions to ask
      kiosk users:
    </p><ul>
      <li>When do you use the kiosks? Do you ever plan to use them in advance?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Most users report using the kiosks only when they realize they need to, and don't
        plan to use them in advance.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>What are you usually trying to do at a kiosk?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Users unanimously reported trying to refill a MetroCard they already own.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>How familiar are you with all the screens?
        How quickly are you able to find what you're looking for?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Most users said that they sometimes have trouble navigating to the screen
        they want, and are unfamiliar with the structure of the options available. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Does the layout of the payment panels on the machine make sense to you?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Most users found the panels to be logical, but a few still experienced difficulty.
         For example, some users confused the MetroCard slot with the
         credit card slot when paying.  </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Observations</h3>
    <p>I also observed several users interacting with the kiosk, and recorded the following
    observations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most riders attempt to make their selections as quickly as possible. Many were
      in a hurry to catch a train.</li>
      <li>Users spend almost all of their time on the screen.</li>
      <li>Users sometimes have to go back because they made the wrong selection.</li>
      <li>Some riders are children, elderly, or inebriated. These users had a difficult time
      understanding the options and selecting correctly. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <p>Based the model of interaction created from my questions and observations,
      I developed two personas for kiosk users:</p>
    <p><b>Eduardo</b> lives in Queens, far from his work as a cook in Manhattan.
      Like most subway riders, his commute is a stressful part of his day,
      especially when his card runs out or he forgets it at home. </p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="./MetroCard Kiosk Project_files/eduardo.png" alt="Eduardo" style="width:750px;height:600px;">
    <br>
    <p><b>Kate</b> is a young professional who lives in Brooklyn. She usually bikes to get around,
      but uses the subway to go out in Manhattan and come home after.
       Like many New Yorkers, she doesnâ€™t use the subway often so she never has a
       large balance on her card. </p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="./MetroCard Kiosk Project_files/kate.png" alt="Kate" style="width:750px;height:600px;">
    <h3>Storyboard</h3>
    <p>Of these two personas, I believe that Eduado's best reflects the experiences
    of everyday subway users. I chose to make a storyboard to represent his
  experience with the kiosks:</p>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="./MetroCard Kiosk Project_files/storyboard.png" alt="Storyboard" style="width:1000px;height:1200px;">
  <p>Though Eduardo's story is fictitious, it represents the struggles of thousands of
  New Yorkers who use MetroCard kiosks every day.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
  Of course, there are a variety of other design considerations for these kiosks.
  The kiosks were made intentionally bulky to prevent vandalism and make cleaning easier.
Additionally, they must be accessible to riders with disabilities. However, I believe that
New Yorkers deserve a better kiosk, using new technology and a people-centered design.</p>
